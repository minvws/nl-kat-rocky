/*
1. Configuration and helpers
Abstracts folder
The abstracts/ folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project. Every global variable, function,
mixin and placeholder should be put in here.

The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.

https://sass-guidelin.es/#abstracts-folder
*/
@import "./abstracts/all.scss";

/*
2. Vendors
Vendors folder
And last but not least, most projects will have a vendors/ folder containing all the CSS files from external libraries
and frameworks – Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI, FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered, and so on.

https://sass-guidelin.es/#vendors-folder
*/
@import "manon.scss";
@import "./vendors/all.scss";
@import "./vendor/two-factor.scss";

/*
3. Base stuff
Base
The `base/` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. In there, you might find the reset
file, some typographic rules, and probably a stylesheet defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements.

https://sass-guidelin.es/#base-folder
*/
@import "./base/all.scss";

/*
4. Layout-related sections
Layout folder
The `layout/` folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application. This folder could have
stylesheets for the main parts of the site (header, footer, navigation, sidebar…), the grid system or even CSS styles
for all the forms.

https://sass-guidelin.es/#layout-folder
*/
// @import "./layout/all.scss";

/*
5. Components
Components folder
For smaller components, there is the `components/` folder. While `layout/` is macro (defining the global wireframe),
components/ is more focused on widgets. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget,
and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in components/ since the whole
site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.

https://sass-guidelin.es/#components-folder

@import "./components/all.scss";

/* 
6. Theme
Branding, and visual theme layer. 
*/
@import "themes/soft/manon-variables.scss"; /* Theme */

/*
7. Page-specific styles
PAGES FOLDER
If you have page-specific styles, it is better to put them in a `pages/` folder, in a file named after the page. For
instance, it’s not uncommon to have very specific styles for the home page hence the need for a `_home.scss` file in
`pages/`.

https://sass-guidelin.es/#pages-folder

// @import './pages/all.scss';
@import "./layout/all.scss";
